This function uses the main socket of the server (called ***serversock***) for the transmission. The user mostly interacts with the server through the serversock. Server may hold additional ***datasocks*** that are used for background- and special data transmission. The server connects the client with a datasock if needed. The client can send data through any connected socket with `sendData()`. The data will be encoded with `pickle.dumps()` and sent to the server. Most python objects including strings, numbers, lists or class objects can be transmitted this way. All connected sockets are stored in the `client.clientsocks` dictionary, addressable through their connected port. A third way of interacting is through `sendRequest()`. This allows to request and return certain data from the server. Available *requestables* are defined by the server.\n",
